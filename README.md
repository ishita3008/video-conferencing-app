### AGILE METHODOLOGIES USED:
1.	I categorized the whole app into theme, epics, user stories and tasks and thereafter planned the work flow into 4 sprints and worked accordingly.
2.	I kept on noting down the bugs and issues I encountered and the ones which I was able to resolve, jotted down under closed issues and the ones I am still working on figuring out, I have put them under open issues.
3.	Further, I have kept the ideas and features I wish to implement in the future under the backlog table with proper segregation into epics, user stories and tasks.
The detailed agile approach I followed: https://1drv.ms/x/s!AuF_GqhwqqsxoHzTYqMtRk0upvIW?e=gceTC8

4.	I also kept a track of the work To Do, the work Done and the work I was currently doing during all these 4 sprints using the Scrum Board.

5.	Throughout the project, I followed the CI CD approach. With Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery, I kept on adding new deliverables to the project and continuously deployed the app, new features were added to the application but at no point the service was taken down.
